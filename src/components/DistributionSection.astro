          The Distance We Run will be shared through a grassroots, self-distribution initiative designed to foster public dialogue around grief, recovery, and civic responsibility. Screenings will take place in high schools, town halls, libraries, and community spaces across Vermont, positioning the film as a catalyst for conversation rather than a standalone event.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-neutral-600 mb-6 font-sans">
          Each screening will be accompanied by thoughtfully developed discussion guides that invite reflection on the film's themes, ethical questions, and local responses to loss and healing. By partnering with educators, municipalities, and community organizations, the project emphasizes accessibility, reflection, and sustained engagement. This approach encourages communities to move from shared viewing toward deeper understanding, dialogue, and collective care for people in recovery.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-neutral-600 font-sans">
          Once the community screenings are completed, the film will be made available for educational distribution through New Day Films or a similar organization (pending acceptance).
