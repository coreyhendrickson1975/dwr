          Grief, Recovery &amp; Collective Responsibility
        </h3>
        <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-secondary-foreground mb-6 font-sans">
          The Distance We Run explores grief, recovery, and collective responsibility in the aftermath of substance use disorder. Using one father's response to loss as a lens on a broader community crisis, the film examines the long timeline of healing. It centers on Chip, a Vermont father whose son, Michael, died from an opioid overdose. Rather than framing the story solely around tragedy, the film asks what comes after loss and how individuals and communities search for meaning, connection, and pathways forward when prevention has failed.

          In the wake of Michael's death, Chip turns to ultramarathon running as a way to remain close to his son's spirit. Physical exertion becomes a means of transforming grief into action. What begins as a private act of endurance evolves into a public commitment to supporting people in recovery and promoting healthy alternatives to addiction. Through this shift, the film traces the movement from personal coping to collective responsibility.

          The narrative unfolds across two intertwined arcs. One follows Chip's preparation for the Infinitus, a 100 mile trail ultramarathon that tests discipline and resolve. Running is not presented as a solution, but as a framework for healing. Parallel to the race is the slower work of building a grassroots recovery effort through awareness, partnership, and consistent support for people navigating sobriety. By placing these journeys side by side, the film challenges the notion that healing comes through singular achievements and emphasizes its relational and sustained nature.

          Set against Vermont's rural landscape, The Distance We Run blends verité observation with composed interviews. The film asks how communities can respond to loss with accountability and preventative care. It shows how recovery can be understood not as an endpoint, but as an ongoing practice shaped by presence, responsibility, and hope.
