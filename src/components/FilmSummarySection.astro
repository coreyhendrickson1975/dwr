          The Distance We Run follows Chip, a Vermont father building a legacy after losing his son Michael to an opioid overdose. Channeling grief into action, Chip trains for a 100-mile trail ultramarathon while founding Trail Run 4 Recovery, a grassroots nonprofit supporting people in recovery.

          The film documents the physical toll of his training: solitary runs through snow-covered trails, visits to recovery specialists, emphasizing strain and vulnerability over athletic spectacle. Running parallels his behind-the-scenes work of meeting community members, securing funding, and navigating the demands of sustaining a mission-driven organization alongside his job and family responsibilities.

        <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-neutral-600 mb-6 font-sans">
          Chip's journey intersects with collaborators including Dawn and Greg Tatro of Jenna's Promise, Danielle Wallace of The Turning Point Center, race director Andy Weinberg, and mentor Jim Ploof, each offering insight into recovery support and endurance culture.

          The 100-mile race becomes an emotional and physical crucible testing Chip's resolve, but the film remains focused on what the effort represents rather than conventional success. In the aftermath, Chip carries the experience forward, deepening his recovery work while confronting the challenge of sustaining purpose beyond the finish line. The film reframes recovery as a collective, lifelong effort: grief transformed through endurance and community.
